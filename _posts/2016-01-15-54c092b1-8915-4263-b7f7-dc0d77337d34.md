I developed the High Five for Mental Wellness program for me (adult with lived experience) and Creative Spark.  The High Five program helps build psychological resilience, confidence and better health overall.  While the project is focused on supporting individuals and families dealing with stress, anxiety and mental illness, it is a great program for anyone interested in developing a more positive experience in life.
